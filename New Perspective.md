# New-Perspective
During a moment of enlightenment, after an extended rest, I developed a new approach and perspective (for myself) to problem solving.


What is it that I don't understand? How can I get there in a smooth way? 
If I don't don't know exactly what it is that I don't understand, seek that out.
Break it down.  Attempt progress in a calm and smooth manner.  Inner Peace.
Can be quickly or slowly depending on what is appropriate.  Sometimes, one good thing a day is enough.
*Consistent and patient progress always wins*

Be patient. And try to have as much fun as possible. Let go of any self hatred.
Love the learning.  Love the exploration.  Love the unknown. 
Love the pause.  Love the break. Love the uncertainty.
It's not a struggle.  It's not violent.  It's graceful. It's kind and gentle. It's a striving toward.
Consider. Be Thoughtful.  Be open. Be humble to the change.
Slowly walk toward the light.  Float towards it. Walk with me until I'm able to float/soar.
Follow the rhythm.  Follow the light.  If I don't see it, consciously seek it first before moving on.  It's there.  No sense in moving on without it.
You don't make progress in the dark, or while running in a sandstorm in the desert.  You only get off the path.

The solution to the problem exists.  I am just trying to transform myself into the type of person who can produce the solution and bring forth its existence into the world.  
Is the work internal or external? I am either cultivating myself to become the type of person who will produce these solutions, or I am applying myself creatively to the universe
in order to bring the solution to reality.  If I patiently seek, I will find what I'm looking (any answer, or whatever it is I'm looking) for.

Love the process. Love the pressure. Embrace my journey. Embrace the contemplation.  Seek out that which causes the fire in my heart to burn. 
Do it for the love of learning.  Do it for the pleasure and privledge of learning.  It should feel really good and be fun.  I love it.
Deep down inside, I do.  Just allow myself to be fully expressed and to live it. Connect with others who feel the same way.


I love you (to myself).  Happy to be here.
